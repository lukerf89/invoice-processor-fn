# Phase 02: Creative-Coop Quantity Extraction Fix

## Executive Summary

**Status**: CRITICAL - Quantity extraction returning 0 for all Creative-Coop XS products
**Business Impact**: 41 detected XS products → 0 final output rows (100% data loss)
**Root Cause**: Quantity patterns don't match CS003837319_Error 2.PDF tabular format
**Timeline**: 3-4 hours for complete fix with TDD methodology

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- ✅ XS-code detection: 41/41 products detected (100% success)
- ✅ UPC mapping: All products mapped to descriptions
- ✅ Product processing: Algorithmic pattern matching working
- ❌ **Quantity extraction: 0/41 quantities extracted (100% failure)**

### Specific Issue
The CS003837319_Error 2.PDF uses a tabular format with structured columns:

```
Product Code | UPC         | Description              | Qty Ord | Qty Alloc | Qty Shipped | Qty BkOrd | U/M  | List Price | Your Price | Your Extd Price
XS9826A      | 191009727774| 6"H Metal Ballerina... | 24      | 0         | 0           | 24        | each | 2.00       | 1.60       | 38.40
XS8911A      | 191009710615| 4-3/4"L x 3-1/2"W...   | 12      | 0         | 0           | 0         | each | 10.00      | 8.00       | 0.00
```

**Current patterns fail** because they look for:
- `"8 0 lo each"` - formatted quantity patterns
- `"6 0 Set"` - unit-specific patterns

**Needed**: Column-based extraction from tabular data structure.

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Extract quantities from tabular Creative-Coop format
   - Process CS003837319_Error 2.PDF: 41 products → 20+ output rows
   - Handle mixed quantity formats (some 0, some >0)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing D-code vendors

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - TDD methodology with 95%+ test coverage
   - Performance within Zapier 160s timeout
   - Algorithmic processing (no hardcoding)
   - Structured error handling and logging

3. **Quality Requirements**:
   - All engineering principles 1-10 applied
   - Comprehensive edge case testing
   - Integration tests with existing Creative-Coop logic

## Technical Approach

### Strategy: Multi-Tier Quantity Extraction

**Tier 1**: Tabular Column Parsing (NEW)
- Parse tabular format with column headers
- Extract Qty_Ord from 4th column after UPC
- Handle whitespace and formatting variations

**Tier 2**: Pattern-based Fallback (EXISTING)
- Keep existing "8 0 lo each" patterns
- Used for non-tabular Creative-Coop invoices
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Tier 3**: Context-aware Processing
- Use product code position to locate quantity
- Handle multi-line descriptions
- Parse combined entity text intelligently

### Implementation Architecture

```python
def extract_creative_coop_quantity_improved(text, product_code):
    """
    Multi-tier quantity extraction for Creative-Coop invoices

    Tier 1: Tabular column parsing for structured invoices
    Tier 2: Pattern-based extraction for formatted text
    Tier 3: Context-aware parsing for mixed formats
    """

    # Tier 1: Try tabular extraction first
    qty = extract_quantity_from_table_columns(text, product_code)
    if qty is not None:
        return qty

    # Tier 2: Fallback to existing patterns
    qty = extract_quantity_from_patterns(text, product_code)
    if qty is not None:
        return qty

    # Tier 3: Context-aware extraction
    return extract_quantity_from_context(text, product_code)
```
