- **Processing accuracy**: Current ~30% → Target 90%+ (restored to previous Phase 02 performance)
- **Invoice number extraction**: Current 0% → Target 100%
- **Product description extraction**: Current ~30% → Target 95%
- **Price extraction**: Current ~50% → Target 95%
- **Quantity extraction**: Current ~50% → Target 90%
- **Manual review reduction**: 70% → <10% of processed items requiring manual intervention
- **Processing time**: Maintain sub-60 second processing within Zapier timeout limits

### Business Impact Targets
- **ROI Timeline**: Immediate payback through restored automation (estimated 20+ hours/week manual work elimination)
- **Error cost reduction**: Eliminate order tracking failures due to missing invoice numbers
- **Process reliability**: 95%+ successful processing rate for Creative Coop invoices

## Current State Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis (Based on Evidence)

**Critical Failure Pattern Identified:**
1. **Invoice Number Extraction Complete Failure**: The PDF clearly shows "ORDER NO: CS003837319" but 100% of output rows have blank invoice numbers
2. **Two-Tier Processing Breakdown**: First 43 rows have complete data, rows 44-130 have degraded format with identical placeholder values
3. **Pattern Recognition Failure**: Rows 44+ show "Traditional D-code format" with duplicate "$1.60, 24" values indicating fallback processing failure

**Evidence from CS003837319_Error.pdf Analysis:**
- **Invoice Number Present**: "ORDER NO: CS003837319" clearly visible in header
- **Rich Product Data Available**: 130+ products with complete Product Code, UPC, quantities, prices
- **Tabular Structure**: Well-organized table format with distinct columns for all required fields
- **Multi-page Document**: 15 pages of structured invoice data

**Current Processing Failure Points:**
1. **Invoice Number Extraction Logic**: Creative Coop processing function failing to extract "CS003837319" from "ORDER NO:" field
2. **Product Mapping Algorithm**: Only processing first 43 products correctly, then falling back to placeholder data
3. **Quantity vs. Shipped Distinction**: Not correctly identifying shipped quantities vs. ordered quantities
4. **Multi-page Processing**: Potential failure to process all pages of invoice systematically

### Current Processing Flow Issues

**Based on main.py Analysis:**
- `process_creative_coop_document()` contains sophisticated multi-tier processing but appears to have critical gaps
- Invoice number extraction uses pattern `r"Invoice\s*#?\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"` but Creative Coop format is "ORDER NO:"
- Product mapping function `extract_creative_coop_product_mappings_corrected()` may have scope limitations
- Fallback processing creating placeholder entries instead of proper extraction

## Requirements
