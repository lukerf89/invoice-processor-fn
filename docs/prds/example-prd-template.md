# PRD Template - Invoice Processing Improvement

## Business Objective
[What business problem are we solving?]
Example: "Improve Creative-Coop invoice processing accuracy from 75% to 90% to reduce manual review time by 20 hours/week"

## Success Criteria
[Measurable outcomes]
- Processing accuracy: [Current %] → [Target %]
- Processing time: [Current time] → [Target time]
- Manual review reduction: [Hours saved per week]
- Vendor coverage: [Current vendors] → [New vendors supported]

## Current State Analysis
### Current Processing Flow
[Describe how invoices are currently processed]

### Current Pain Points
- [Pain point 1 with impact]
- [Pain point 2 with impact]
- [Pain point 3 with impact]

### Current Performance Metrics
- Processing accuracy: [X]%
- Average processing time: [X] seconds
- Timeout rate: [X]%
- Manual review rate: [X]%

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [FR1]: [Specific functionality needed]
- [FR2]: [Specific functionality needed]
- [FR3]: [Specific functionality needed]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Must complete within 160-second Zapier timeout
- **Accuracy**: Target >90% line item extraction accuracy
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ invoices/day

### AI Service Requirements
- **Primary**: Document AI with fallback mechanisms
- **Secondary**: Gemini AI (when timeout issues resolved)
- **Fallback**: Text pattern extraction

### Vendor Support Requirements
- **Current Vendors**: HarperCollins, Creative-Coop, OneHundred80, Rifle Paper
- **New Vendors**: [List any new vendors to support]
- **Pattern Requirements**: All processing must be algorithmic (no hardcoding)

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Zapier 160-second timeout limit
- Google Cloud Function 1GB memory limit
- Google Sheets API rate limits

### Business Constraints
- [Budget limitations]
- [Timeline constraints]
- [Resource availability]

### Assumptions
- [Key assumption 1]
- [Key assumption 2]

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk Items
- [Risk 1]: [Impact and mitigation]
- [Risk 2]: [Impact and mitigation]

### Dependencies
- [External dependency 1]
- [External dependency 2]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Processing accuracy meets target percentage
- [ ] Processing time within timeout limits
- [ ] All test invoices process successfully
- [ ] Error handling works for all failure modes
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Performance monitoring is in place
