## Risk Scoring for Invoice Processing
- **Probability**:
  - Low (10% - rare occurrence): Happens less than once per quarter
  - Medium (30% - periodic): Happens monthly or quarterly
  - High (60% - frequent): Happens weekly or more often
- **Impact**:
  - Low (minor delay): < 1 day delay, minimal manual work
  - Medium (processing degradation): 1-3 days delay, significant manual intervention
  - High (system failure): > 3 days delay, major business disruption
- **Priority Score**: Probability Ã— Impact = Risk Priority (1-36 scale)

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Avoid**: Change architecture to eliminate risk (e.g., remove dependency on unreliable service)
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact (e.g., implement fallback processing, add monitoring)
- **Transfer**: Use external services or redundancy (e.g., multiple AI service providers, insurance)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor risk (e.g., accept occasional manual review for edge cases)

## Invoice Processing Specific Risks

### High Priority Risks (Score 15-36)

2. **New Vendor Invoice Format** (High probability 60%, Medium impact 20 = Score 12)
   - **Description**: Existing vendor changes invoice format, breaking pattern recognition
   - **Mitigation**: Pattern monitoring, regular accuracy validation, flexible algorithmic patterns
   - **Contingency**: Rapid pattern development, temporary manual review

3. **Zapier Timeout Exceeded** (High probability 60%, Medium impact 20 = Score 12)
   - **Description**: Processing time exceeds 160-second Zapier timeout limit
   - **Mitigation**: Performance optimization, processing time monitoring, code efficiency
   - **Contingency**: Direct API integration, async processing, webhook retries

4. **Processing Accuracy Below 80%** (Medium probability 30%, High impact 30 = Score 9)
   - **Description**: Line item extraction accuracy drops below acceptable business threshold
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, pattern validation, accuracy monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Enhanced manual review process, pattern refinement

### Medium Priority Risks (Score 8-14)

5. **Google Sheets API Rate Limits** (Medium probability 30%, Medium impact 20 = Score 6)
   - **Description**: Exceeding Google Sheets API quotas, causing write failures
   - **Mitigation**: Batch processing, retry logic, quota monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Temporary local storage, staggered processing

6. **Large PDF Processing Failures** (Medium probability 30%, Medium impact 20 = Score 6)
   - **Description**: Memory or timeout issues with PDFs > 10MB
   - **Mitigation**: Memory optimization, streaming processing, file size validation
   - **Contingency**: Manual processing for large files, file splitting

7. **Secret Manager Authentication Issues** (Low probability 10%, High impact 30 = Score 3)
   - **Description**: API key access failures preventing service authentication
   - **Mitigation**: Key rotation procedures, access monitoring, backup authentication
   - **Contingency**: Emergency key provisioning, manual credential management

### Low Priority Risks (Score 1-7)

8. **Cloud Function Cold Start Latency** (High probability 60%, Low impact 10 = Score 6)
   - **Description**: First request after idle period takes longer to process
   - **Mitigation**: Keep-alive requests, function warming, performance monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Accept occasional slower first requests

9. **PDF Corruption or Malformed Files** (Low probability 10%, Medium impact 20 = Score 2)
   - **Description**: Uploaded PDFs are corrupted or not properly formatted
