## Executive Summary
**Business Objective**: [Specific invoice processing improvement]
**Success Criteria**: [Measurable accuracy, speed, and vendor coverage targets]
**Timeline**: [Duration with AI service integration milestones]
**Risk Level**: [Low|Medium|High with primary concerns]
**Resource Requirements**: [AI quotas, test data, infrastructure needs]

## Pre-Phase Checklist (Day 0 - Before Starting)

### 1. Prerequisites Validation
- [ ] Google Cloud Function environment ready
- [ ] Document AI processor configured and tested
- [ ] Google Sheets API access verified
- [ ] Test invoice datasets available for all target vendors
- [ ] Google Secret Manager configured for API keys
- [ ] Zapier webhook endpoint tested with timeout requirements

### 2. Safety & Backup Measures
```bash
# Backup current Cloud Function version
gcloud functions describe process_invoice --region=us-central1 > backup_function_config.yaml

# Export current Google Sheets data
# [Specific backup commands for current processing state]

# Create rollback deployment package
cp main.py main_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).py
```

### 3. Risk Mitigation Setup
- [ ] Multi-tier processing fallback verified (Gemini → Document AI → Text parsing)
- [ ] Performance monitoring baseline established for current processing times
- [ ] Error handling and logging configured for AI service failures
- [ ] Manual processing workflow documented for critical failures

## Implementation Strategy

    G --> H[Google Sheets Output]
    C --> I[Error Handling & Retry]
    I --> J[Dead Letter Queue]
```

**Critical Path Analysis**:
- PDF Processing → AI Service Selection → Line Item Extraction → Vendor Pattern Application → Google Sheets Write
- **Bottlenecks**: AI service response times, Google Sheets API rate limits, large PDF processing
- **Parallel Tracks**: Vendor pattern development, test dataset creation, monitoring implementation

### Technical Integration Points
- **AI Services**: Document AI (primary), Gemini AI (when re-enabled), with timeout and retry handling
- **Google Sheets API**: Column B:G writing with rate limit management and batch operations
- **Google Secret Manager**: Secure API key storage and rotation
- **Zapier Integration**: Webhook processing with 160-second timeout compliance
- **PDF Processing**: Secure handling without file system exposure, memory management for large files

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase [N].1: [Component] (Day X - Time Period)

#### Scope & Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: [Specific technical outcome]
- **Business Value**: [Processing improvement impact]  
- **Success Criteria**: [Validation requirements]

#### Implementation Steps
```bash
# Step 1: Develop and test vendor-specific patterns
python test_scripts/test_[vendor]_processing.py
python document_ai_explorer.py test_invoices/[vendor]_sample.pdf --save-json

# Step 2: Implement algorithmic extraction functions
# Add to main.py following pattern-based approach (no hardcoding)

# Step 3: Test multi-tier processing fallback
python test_scripts/test_integrated_main.py

# Step 4: Performance validation within timeout limits
python test_scripts/test_performance_validation.py
```

#### Validation & Testing
- [ ] Process 10 sample invoices with >85% accuracy
- [ ] Verify processing completes within 120 seconds (buffer for 160s limit)
- [ ] Test fallback behavior when primary AI service fails
- [ ] Validate Google Sheets output format and column alignment

#### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If this phase fails, execute:
gcloud functions deploy process_invoice --source=. --entry-point=process_invoice \
  --runtime=python312 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=freckled-hen-analytics,..." \
  --timeout=540s --memory=1GiB

# Restore previous main.py version
cp main_backup_[date].py main.py
```

### Phase [N].2: [Next Component] (Day Y - Time Period)
[Same detailed structure as above]

## Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy for Invoice Processing

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Pattern extraction functions, vendor detection algorithms, data normalization
- **Integration Testing**: Document AI service calls, Google Sheets writes, Zapier webhook processing
- **Performance Testing**: 160-second timeout compliance, large PDF handling, concurrent processing
- **Accuracy Testing**: Vendor-specific invoice processing against known ground truth datasets
- **Error Recovery Testing**: AI service failures, malformed PDFs, Google Sheets API limits

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Time**: Standard invoice (< 5MB) in under 60 seconds, complex invoice in under 120 seconds
- **Accuracy**: >90% line item extraction accuracy for supported vendors
