- **Google Sheets API**: Column B:G writing with rate limit management and batch operations
- **Google Secret Manager**: Secure API key storage and rotation
- **Zapier Integration**: Webhook processing with 160-second timeout compliance
- **PDF Processing**: Secure handling without file system exposure, memory management for large files

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase [N].1: [AI Service Component] (Day X - Time Period)

#### Scope & Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: [Specific AI processing improvement - e.g., improve Creative-Coop extraction accuracy from 75% to 90%]
- **Business Value**: [Why this improvement matters - e.g., reduce manual invoice processing by 50 hours/month]
- **Success Criteria**: [How to verify completion - e.g., 9/10 test invoices process correctly with new patterns]

#### Implementation Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Develop and test vendor-specific patterns
python test_scripts/test_[vendor]_processing.py
python document_ai_explorer.py test_invoices/[vendor]_sample.pdf --save-json

# Step 2: Implement algorithmic extraction functions
# Add to main.py following pattern-based approach (no hardcoding)

# Step 3: Test multi-tier processing fallback
python test_scripts/test_integrated_main.py

# Step 4: Performance validation within timeout limits
python test_scripts/test_performance_validation.py
```

#### Validation & Testing
- [ ] Process 10 sample invoices with >85% accuracy
- [ ] Verify processing completes within 120 seconds (buffer for 160s limit)
- [ ] Test fallback behavior when primary AI service fails
- [ ] Validate Google Sheets output format and column alignment

#### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If this phase fails, execute:
gcloud functions deploy process_invoice --source=. --entry-point=process_invoice \
  --runtime=python312 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=freckled-hen-analytics,..." \
