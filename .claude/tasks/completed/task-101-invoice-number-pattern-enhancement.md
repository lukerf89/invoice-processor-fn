# Task 101: Creative-Coop Invoice Number Pattern Enhancement - ORDER NO Support

## TDD Cycle Overview
**RED**: Write failing tests that demonstrate current invoice extraction patterns don't detect "ORDER NO:" format used by Creative-Coop invoices
**GREEN**: Enhance invoice number extraction in `process_creative_coop_document()` to support both "ORDER NO:" and "Invoice #:" patterns
**REFACTOR**: Create centralized invoice pattern matching with proper fallback hierarchy

## Test Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for "ORDER NO:" pattern extraction (CS003837319 test case)
- [ ] Unit tests for existing "Invoice #:" pattern preservation (regression protection)
- [ ] Integration tests using CS003837319_Error document AI output
- [ ] Edge case tests for malformed invoice number formats
- [ ] Performance tests ensuring pattern matching completes within timeout limits
- [ ] Error handling tests for missing invoice number scenarios

## Implementation Steps (Red-Green-Refactor)

### Step 1: RED - Write Failing Tests

```python
# Test file: test_scripts/test_creative_coop_invoice_number_extraction.py
import pytest
import re
from unittest.mock import Mock
from main import process_creative_coop_document

def test_order_no_pattern_fails_with_current_extraction():
    """Test that current extraction fails to find ORDER NO: CS003837319 - RED test"""
    # Simulate Document AI document with ORDER NO format
    mock_document = Mock()
    mock_document.text = """
    Creative Coop Invoice Processing
    ORDER NO: CS003837319
    Date: 09/05/2025
    Product listings...
    """
    mock_document.entities = [
        Mock(type_="invoice_id", mention_text=""),  # Empty - should fail
        Mock(type_="invoice_date", mention_text="09/05/2025")
    ]

    # Current pattern from main.py line 2852-2856
    current_pattern = r"Invoice\s*#?\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"
    match = re.search(current_pattern, mock_document.text, re.IGNORECASE)

    # RED: This should fail with current pattern
    assert match is None, f"Current pattern should not match ORDER NO format, but found: {match}"

def test_extract_cs003837319_returns_empty_currently():
    """Test that CS003837319 invoice number extraction currently fails - RED test"""
    # Load actual CS003837319_Error Document AI output
    import json

    with open('test_invoices/CS003837319_Error_docai_output.json', 'r') as f:
        doc_data = json.load(f)

    # Create mock document from actual data
    mock_document = Mock()
    mock_document.text = doc_data.get('text', '')
    mock_document.entities = []

    # Add entities without invoice_id to simulate current failure
    for entity_data in doc_data.get('entities', []):
        entity = Mock()
        entity.type_ = entity_data.get('type', '')
        entity.mention_text = entity_data.get('mentionText', '')
        mock_document.entities.append(entity)

    # Process with current implementation
    results = process_creative_coop_document(mock_document)

    # RED: Should demonstrate current invoice number extraction failure
    # Check if any row contains empty invoice number
    has_empty_invoice = any(not row[1] for row in results if len(row) > 1)
    assert has_empty_invoice, "Current implementation should fail to extract CS003837319"

def test_invoice_hash_pattern_still_works():
    """Test that existing Invoice # pattern continues working"""
    mock_document = Mock()
    mock_document.text = "Invoice #: ABC123456"
    mock_document.entities = [Mock(type_="invoice_id", mention_text="")]

    current_pattern = r"Invoice\s*#?\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"
    match = re.search(current_pattern, mock_document.text, re.IGNORECASE)

    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(1) == "ABC123456"

def test_empty_document_handling():
    """Test handling of edge cases with missing text"""
    mock_document = Mock()
    mock_document.text = ""
    mock_document.entities = []

    results = process_creative_coop_document(mock_document)

    # Should handle gracefully without crashing
    assert isinstance(results, list)
```

### Step 2: GREEN - Minimal Implementation

Replace the invoice number extraction logic in `process_creative_coop_document()` (lines 2849-2856):

```python
# Enhanced invoice number extraction for Creative-Coop
def extract_creative_coop_invoice_number(document_text, entities):
    """Extract invoice numbers from Creative-Coop ORDER NO: or Invoice #: formats"""
    # First try from entities
    invoice_number = entities.get("invoice_id", "")
    if invoice_number:
        return invoice_number

    # Creative-Coop specific patterns in order of preference
    patterns = [
        r"ORDER\s+NO\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)",          # Primary: "ORDER NO: CS003837319"
        r"Order\s+No\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)",          # Alternative capitalization
        r"Order\s+Number\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)",      # Alternative format
        r"Invoice\s*#?\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)",        # Fallback: existing pattern
    ]

    for pattern in patterns:
        match = re.search(pattern, document_text, re.IGNORECASE)
        if match:
            invoice_number = match.group(1)
            print(f"✅ Invoice number extracted using pattern '{pattern}': {invoice_number}")
            return invoice_number

    print("❌ No invoice number pattern matched")
    return ""

# Update process_creative_coop_document() to use new function
# Replace lines 2849-2856 with:
invoice_number = extract_creative_coop_invoice_number(document.text, entities)
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve Design

Create centralized pattern management and add comprehensive logging:

```python
# Add constants section
CREATIVE_COOP_INVOICE_PATTERNS = [
    ("ORDER_NO", r"ORDER\s+NO\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"),
    ("ORDER_NO_ALT", r"Order\s+No\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"),
    ("ORDER_NUMBER", r"Order\s+Number\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"),
    ("INVOICE_HASH", r"Invoice\s*#?\s*:\s*([A-Z0-9]+)"),
]

def extract_creative_coop_invoice_number_enhanced(document_text, entities):
    """Enhanced invoice number extraction with pattern tracking"""
    # First try from entities
    invoice_number = entities.get("invoice_id", "")
    if invoice_number:
        print(f"✅ Invoice number from entities: {invoice_number}")
        return invoice_number

    # Try each pattern with detailed logging
    for pattern_name, pattern in CREATIVE_COOP_INVOICE_PATTERNS:
        match = re.search(pattern, document_text, re.IGNORECASE)
        if match:
            invoice_number = match.group(1)
            print(f"✅ Invoice number extracted using {pattern_name}: {invoice_number}")
            return invoice_number
        else:
            print(f"⚠️ Pattern {pattern_name} did not match")

    print("❌ No invoice number pattern matched - check document format")
    return ""
```

- [ ] **Regression Prevention**: All existing vendor processing continues working
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when no patterns match
- [ ] **Logging**: Clear diagnostic information for troubleshooting pattern failures

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Breaking existing invoice number extraction for other Creative-Coop formats
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive pattern precedence testing, fallback to original pattern
- **Detection**: Automated tests with multiple Creative-Coop invoice samples

**Medium Risk**: Performance impact from multiple regex pattern evaluation
- **Mitigation**: Early termination on first match, pattern optimization
- **Detection**: Processing time monitoring, timeout alerts

**Low Risk**: ORDER NO format variations not covered by initial patterns
- **Mitigation**: Extensible pattern array, comprehensive test cases
- **Detection**: Production monitoring for extraction failures

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: CS003837319_Error.pdf processes with correct invoice number "CS003837319" (currently blank)
- **Secondary**: All existing Creative-Coop invoices maintain extraction accuracy
- **Performance**: Invoice number extraction completes in <10ms per document
- **Quality**: Zero production incidents related to missing invoice numbers
- **Business**: Proper order tracking restored for 100% of Creative-Coop invoices

## Files Modified
